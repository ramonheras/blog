## Hi,

I'm Ramon Heras, a Software Engineer passionate about what technology achieves in improving our lives. I've played with many technologies in various fields, from AI, API design, and micro-services, to DevOps. In 2021, I decided to switch from embedded systems design to software. The technology I've used the most during the past year is Kubernetes, followed by Node and GitLab CI.

My coworkers regard me as a proactive and enthusiastic team member who always looks for new ways to go above and beyond. I have a lot of fun brainstorming and discussing new tech trends; taking part in turning ideas into real products used and enjoyed by people is very fulfilling to me. Another quality most people associate with me is fast-learning. I am really thankful for such respect and consideration.

My attitude towards big challenges is starting small and using observability along with an iterative and incremental process to grow ideas in the right direction quickly.

## Some Tech I've played with...

- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), C++, Python, C.
- **API Design**: Node.js, OpenAPI 3, Fastify, prom-client, Mercurius GraphQL.
- **Site Reliability**: Kubernetes, Docker, GitLab CI, Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, K6, semantic-release, Renovate, GitHub Workflows, Keycloak, Kustomize, ArgoCD, OpenTelemetry.
- **Databases**: Redis, Cassandra, Elastic-search, Elassandra.
