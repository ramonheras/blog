## Hi

My name is RamÃ³n Heras. I'm a Software Engineer that loves solving complex problems, especially as part of a motivated team ðŸ™Œ. I also enjoy learning new things; new technologies and challenges don't hold me back. Since I'm pretty picky, I prefer to take my time to find reliable and maintainable solutions in the long term; system architecture design is fascinating, innit? Watching YouTube videos is my favorite entertainment, mainly gadget reviews and unboxings.
