## Hi

My name is RamÃ³n Heras. I'm an Software Engineer ğŸ‘¾ that loves solving complex problems, especially if as part of a motivated team ğŸ™Œ. I also enjoy learning new things, I'm not afraid of new technologies and challenges. I'm quite picky and I prefer to take my time to find solutions that are reliable and maintainable in the long term, architecture design is fascinating, innit?. Watching YouTube videos is my favorite entertainment, mainly gadget reviews and unboxings ğŸ¤™.
